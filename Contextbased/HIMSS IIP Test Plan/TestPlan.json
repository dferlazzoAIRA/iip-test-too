    "description": "This test plan is to be used for the testing of the HIMSS-AIRA Immunization Integration Program: Immunization-Related Capabilities and Guidance developed under a cooperative agreement with the American Immunization Registry Association (AIRA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All test cases are required to be executed. The test plan includes both functional and interoperability tests including Vaccine Update Notifications (HL7 V2.5.1 VXU/Z22) and Query and Response (Evaluated History and Forecast Group Z44/Z42). \n \nThis version is updated for use in the early 2023 test cycle. Unlike other test cycles there are two scheduled test plan releases:\n-Release 10.5 is based upon the 10.0 release with minor changes such as advancing years by one when appropriate (dates of administration, birth, observation, privacy status, publicity status, and registry status, Annual influenza vaccination NDCs have been updated to reflect NDCs used in the 2022-2023 flu season. \n\n-Release 10.1.1 includes all the changes made in release 10.5 and may include additional changes, including possible capability changes. \n\nBoth releases align with ONC 2015 Certification Criteria for\u202f? 170.315(f)(1) Transmission to Immunization Registries.\u202fThis test plan is approved by ONC to demonstrate conformance to these criteria. \nThe 10.5 (early 2023) release included (internal bug/issue IDs appear in parentheses):\n\u2022\tClarified the presentation and inventory quantity-on-hand for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine COVID-19 (NDC 59267-1000-01) vaccine that is distributed in packages containing 75 multidose vials (MDV).
